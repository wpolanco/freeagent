# AKS Store Demo

This sample demo app consists of a group of containerized microservices that can be easily deployed into an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This is meant to show a realistic scenario using a polyglot architecture, event-driven design, and common open source back-end services (eg - RabbitMQ, MongoDB). The application also leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 models to generate product descriptions. This can be done using either [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

This application is inspired by another demo app called [Red Dog](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-code).

> Note: This is not meant to be an example of perfect code to be used in production, but more about showing a realistic application running in AKS. 

<!-- 
To walk through a quick deployment of this application, see the [AKS Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli).

To walk through a complete experience where this code is packaged into container images, uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and then run in and AKS cluster, see the [AKS Tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app).

## Architecture

The application has the following services: 

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `makeline-service` | This service handles processing orders from the queue and completing them (Golang) |
| `order-service` | This service is used for placing orders (Javascript) |
| `product-service` | This service is used to perform CRUD operations on products (Rust) |
| `store-front` | Web app for customers to place orders (Vue.js) |
| `store-admin` | Web app used by store employees to view orders in queue and manage products (Vue.js) | 
| `virtual-customer` | Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis (Rust) |
| `virtual-worker` | Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis (Rust) |
| `ai-service` | Optional service for adding generative text and graphics creation (Python) |
| `mongodb` | MongoDB instance for persisted data |
| `rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ for an order queue |

## Run the app on AKS

To learn how to deploy this app to AKS with Azure OpenAI, see [Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/open-ai-quickstart?tabs=aoai).

## Run the app locally

The application is designed to be [run in an AKS cluster](#run-the-app-on-aks), but can also be run locally using Docker Compose.

> **IMPORTANT**: You must have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed to run this app locally.

To run this app locally:

Clone the repo to your development computer and navigate to the directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git
cd aks-store-demo
```

Configure your Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys in [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) using the environment variables in the `aiservice` section:

```yaml
  aiservice:
    build: src/ai-service
    container_name: 'aiservice'
    ...
    environment:
      - USE_AZURE_OPENAI=True # set to False if you are not using Azure OpenAI
      - AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME= # required if using Azure OpenAI
      - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT= # required if using Azure OpenAI
      - OPENAI_API_KEY= # always required
      - OPENAI_ORG_ID= # required if using OpenAI
    ...
```

Alternatively, if you do not have access to Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys, you can run the app without the `ai-service` by commenting out the `aiservice` section in [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml). For example:

```yaml
#  aiservice:
#    build: src/ai-service
#    container_name: 'aiservice'
...
#    networks:
#      - backend_services
```

Start the app using `docker compose`. For example:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To stop the app, you can hit the `CTRL+C` key combination in the terminal window where the app is running.

## Run the app with GitHub Codespaces

This repo also includes [DevContainer configuration](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json), so you can open the repo using [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). This will allow you to run the app in a container in the cloud, without having to install Docker on your local machine. When the Codespace is created, you can run the app using the same instructions as above.
